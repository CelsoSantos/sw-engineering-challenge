## Step 1

Create the basic resources for an Express app (in Typescript), including linters, testing, Dockerfiles, etc.

## Step 2

Re-do the express app and turn it into a class that can be instantiated. This allows us better control over the flow of the application, which will pay off later in the tests executions. This also allows us to start multiple instances of the application (in different ports) should we wish to.
